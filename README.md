# Hue Phillips Integration Plugin

This plugin allows users to link their Hue Phillips smart lights in their home to their RuneLite client.

When the player receives a drop worth over 1M Gp your smart lights will react and turn green.

When the player died your smart lights will react and turn red.

When the player is in a raid and a team member receives a drop, the lights will react and turn purple

When the player receives a pet the lights will react and turn light blue!
